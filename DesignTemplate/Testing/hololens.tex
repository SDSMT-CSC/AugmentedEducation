\section{HoloLens Testing}
The original plan for testing the HoloLens was changed due the custom application being dropped.
The plan changed to making sure the default software on the HoloLens is capable of displaying the files held on the website. The tests were done manually and focused on displaying files download from the website and through a QR code.

    \subsection{Web Testing Process}
    These test involved using the HoloLens to navigate to the website to download the files. The tests followed these steps:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Open Microsoft Edge on the HoloLens and navigate to the website.
        \item Select a file and filetype for the download. FBX files are reqired for the AR viewer in the HoloLens.
        \item Select download and open the file using the viewing software.
        \item Visually compare what is displayed on the HoloLens to the original.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{QR Testing Process}
    These tests were similar to the web test, but used the QR code to download the file rather than website. The tests followed these steps:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item On a computer, navigate to the website's content section.
        \item Select the file and filetype for the download. FBX files are required for the AR viewer in the HoloLens.
        \item Select General QR Code button to get the QR code.
        \item On the HoloLens, load a QR reader and scan the QR code gereated by the website.
        \item Open the file that is automatically downloaded with the viewing software.
        \item Visually compare what is displayed on the HoloLens to the original.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Testing Situations}
    The testing processes described above were used to test many different situations a user might face while using the website. The situations that were test are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different file sizes.
        \item Colored and non-colored models
        \item Files that did not go through conversion during the upload. (FBX files)
        \item Files that were converted during the upload. (OBJ,DAE,STL and PLY files)
        \item Simple and complex files.
    \end{itemize}

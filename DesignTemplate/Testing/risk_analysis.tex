\section{Risk Analysis}
There are two main risks associated with the project. These risks pertain to the functionality of the product itself and the security of users' data.
Minimizing and preventing these risks are vital to providing quality software and positive relationships with users.

The first risk is that the software may fail to convert or render a given input file.
This could be caused by the file being too large or complex for the system to handle, or part of the file is corrupt. 

File security poses the other risk to the project, as some of the files uploaded may contain sensitive or confidential data.
It is a priority to maintain users' privacy and trust, ensuring that the project enforces permissions correctly.

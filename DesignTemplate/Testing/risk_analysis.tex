\section{Risk Analysis}
There are two main risks associated with our project. These risks pertain to the functionality of the product itself and the security of our data.
Minimizing and preventing these risks are vital to providing quality software and positive relationships with users.

The first risk is that the software may fail to convert or render a given input file.
This could be caused by the file being too large or complex for our system to handle, or part of the file is corrupt. 

File security poses the other risk to our project, as some of the files uploaded may contain sensitive or confidential data.
We want to ensure that we maintain our users' privacy and trust as we strive to ensure only specified people can access certain files.

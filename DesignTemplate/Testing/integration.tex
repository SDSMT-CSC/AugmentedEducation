\section{System Integration Testing}
Manual integration tests were performed while integrating the file conversion software with the website. The integration test was relatively simple and only required the executable to be uploaded to Azure and called as it would regularly be with user requests. Website and file conversion software integration was determined to be complete after multiple successful tests of the complete upload $\rightarrow$ conversion $\rightarrow$ download process.

\section{Risk Mitigation}
To mitigate these risks, we have multiple strategies implemented to prevent the issues from happening in the first place.

Addressing the first risk of failed conversion or rendering, we will ensure product quality through rapid iteration and testing of MVPs. 
We have a variety of test files of varying sizes and formats that we have run through our system to make sure we cover many of the common (and uncommon) use cases.
Additionally, we aim to stay informed on the documentation of the libraries and platforms we use in our software to make sure we understand the capabilities and limitations of the tools we are using.
Especially for the file conversion software, we have researched which file types can be run through the libraries and have implemented that functionality in our product and need to communicate to our users which file types are acceptable for our system. 

For the second risk of data security, we try our best to examine and remove any possible security holes in our data flow.
We will need to analyze the website code to limit file access only to properly-privileged users. 
We also plan to implement features such as https and end-to-end encryption to maintain data security on our connections.

\section{Risk Mitigation}
To mitigate risk, multiple preventative strategies have been employed.

Addressing the risk of failed conversion or rendering, system integrity is ensured through rapid iteration and testing of the complete platform with a variety of test files of varying sizes and formats to cover both common and uncommon use cases.
Additionally, this document provides information on the capabilities and limitations of the libraries and tools used in the development and operation of this platform.

Special attention has been paid to noting limitations of acceptable file inputs and precautions have been put in place to notify users at the upload step of the platform. 

Regarding risk of data security, the development team has examined and removed all detectable security holes in the platform's data flow. The Identity and Entity Framework has been chosen to handle file access authorization based on merit and reputation in the professional development community. Additional development of security features presently unavailable are noted and encouraged in Ch. \ref{ch:TODO}.

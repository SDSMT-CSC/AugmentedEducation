\chapter{System and Unit Testing Design}

This section describes the approach taken with regard to system and unit testing.    This chapter does not describe the outcome of those tests.  That will be described in the prototypes chapter.     

\section{Overview}
Provides a brief overview of the testing approach, testing frameworks, and general 
how testing is/will be done to provide a measure of success for the system. 

Each requirement (user story component) should be tested.    A review of objectives and
constraints might be needed here.  

\section{Dependencies}
Describe the basic dependencies which should include unit testing frameworks and 
reference material. 


\section{Test design and setup}
Describe how test cases were developed/designed, setup, and how they connect to the requirements.  This section can 
be extremely involved if a complete list of test cases was warranted for the system.   One 
approach is to list each requirement, module, or component and describe the test.

The unit test framework is described here.

\subsection{Intellectual Property}
Patent application for elements of process possible but not applied for. 

\subsection{Value} 
The time required for an engineer to be trained in the transition between student and working professional averages in the range of 1-2 years. A goal of enhancing the traditional educational experience with this service is to eliminate a portion of the training required for students to make the transition to professionals in their fields. The test results will be able to support the claim that this service will reduce the amount of time is required to successfully make this transition.  With the average entry level engineering salary at about \$70,500, meaning up to \$141,000 or more in training expenses per entry level hire, Augmented Education aims to reduce this need by providing students with a more immersive approach to learning and mastering concepts of design and structure. This is envisioned through noting that, should the new in-classroom experience create more effective learning, more topics and depth will be able to be taught per course.

Additionally, the adaption of AR technology in classrooms is beginning. By being at the forefront of this adoption, institutions like SD Mines will continue to out-pace competition waiting for comfortable trends to be set. 


\subsection{Value Testing} 
A/B testing targeting student engagement, retention, and conceptual clarity will be conducted in classrooms at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Tests will be performed for several semesters where one section of a course taught by a given professor will be able to utilize Augmented Education's technology in the classroom as a learning aid and a control group for comparison will not. For specific courses, aggregate results from previous semesters may also be available for control group comparison. 

\subsection{Value Testimonials}
“Education is an industry based on entertainment. You can learn everything about Calculus from a 1960’s textbook. The information is the same today as it was then, but new textbooks are sold because they are printed in color and with better pictures. Students use YouTube tutorials to learn math because it is effective. The reason people pay for classes with instructors is because we balance presenting information with entertaining the student’s interest in it. Augmented reality in education is that next step in creating a more engaging and entertaining learning environment.” - Dr. Jeff McGough, Computer Science and Mathematics Professor at SD Mines and founder of InTouch L.L.C.

“As an industrial engineering instructor, I run labs where students build bridges and motors using Lego bricks. I do it because it's interactive and helps communicate some of the early concepts. If I could  have system where students could instead see the components of these structures in an animated 3D environment that they could interact with, I would implement it immediately.” - Dr. Adam Piper, Industrial Engineer Professor at SD Mines



\subsection{Sponsor Mission Statement}
InTouch L.L.C. pursues the mission of developing augmented reality and virtual reality (known together as “mixed reality”) solutions for education and enterprise. Hardware and entertainment software for this technology have matured over the past decade while innovators have, until now, overlooked the opportunity to leverage this same technology for applications such as classroom education, 3D advertising, architecture, design, and more.  

Augmented Education seeks to connect higher level education with AR media like never before. By getting Augmented Education into the hands of students today, it will become the standard AR media platform of tomorrow. 

\subsection{Pitch}
Augmented reality, commonly called AR, is a technological advancement that allows individuals to overlay virtual animations into the real world using an optical viewing aid to augment the user’s vision of their surroundings. While headsets offer the most natural AR experience, mobile devices also capable. Augmented Education provides a platform for harnessing this new technology to enhance the traditional education experience with an effective and engaging new medium. 

To demonstrate the Augmented Education service, think back to the last time you were in class learning about a 3D design, calculus graph, or physics problem. No instructor had a choice other than to present 3D content on a 2D chalkboard or projector. Imagine next year you sit in  a South Dakota School of Mines and Technology classroom where the instructor asks you to use your phone to view their presentation. What was once a QR code in the presentation is now a 3D shape appearing in the environment with you. Using your hands, you may bring it closer, manipulate it, turn it around, and perhaps flip through a sequence of animations using your fingertips. On the next slide, the instructor has changed the equation. Scanning the new QR code would allow you to view the new model, compare the differences, and more clearly conceptualize the impact of the changes.

Architecture and civil engineering students often design structures and buildings with 3D design software. With this platform, a student or instructor need only to upload their file to the Augmented Education website before they are able to use an augmented reality headset to scale their design to real world size and step through it, viewing it from the inside or placing it next to a campus building for scale. As collaboration grows, these students may soon be able to use this platform to virtually inspect the architecture of famous buildings from around the world. 

Augmented Education is being developed by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where it will be AB tested over the 2018-2019 academic year for results in student engagement, speed of learning, rate of retention, and conceptual clarity. South Dakota School of Mines and Technology intends to integrate Augmented Education across a variety of disciplines and majors over the 2018-2019 academic year.

\subsection{Elevator Pitch}
Augmented Education is a platform designed to revolutionize educational media by bringing augmented reality to your fingertips. It allows you to embed virtual, 3D designs in real world media using QR codes. This platform allows any 3D design to be opened and interacted with by any Android phone or AR headset. Imagine the application in classrooms and textbooks. Augmented reality is the future of engagement. By getting this technology in the hands of students today, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will set the global standard of educational media tomorrow. 

\subsection{Purpose of the System}

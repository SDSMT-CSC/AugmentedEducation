\chapter{User Stories,  Requirements, and Product Backlog}



\section{Overview}


The purpose of this document is to give the reader a thorough understanding of
not only the product created by this senior design team, but also of the
process behind developing the project.
While creating this document, the development team endeavored to make it detailed enough that it could be the sole resource needed by a similar team to create an exact replica of the product.

The product aims to heighten the education experience for
students, especially in scenarios that require 3D visualization. The goal is to
make 3D content delivery simple so that instructors can take advantage of the
technology and give their students a more immersive, engaging experience.

Once the team had a purpose for the product set out, it was a matter of getting
organized and creating clear definitions of what needed to be done.
In order to define actionable items for the product backlog, the team had to define
the requirements for the project. This was defined through user stories.

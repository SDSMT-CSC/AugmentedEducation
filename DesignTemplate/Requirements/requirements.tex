\chapter{User Stories,  Requirements, and Product Backlog}



\section{Overview}


The purpose of this document is to give the reader a thorough understanding of
not only the product created by this senior design team, but also of the
process behind developing the project. This chapter discusses project purpose, user
requirements, team organization, design, implementation, testing, project
management, and user documentation.

While creating this document, the development team has endeavored to make it detailed enough that it could be the sole resource needed by a similar team to create an exact replica of the product.

The product aims to heighten the education experience for
students, especially in scenarios that require 3D visualization. The goal is to
make 3D content delivery simple so that instructors can take advantage of the
technology and give their students a more immersive, engaging experience.

Once the team had a purpose for the product set out, it was a matter of getting
organized and creating clear definitions of what needed to be done.
In order to define actionable items for the product backlog, the team had to define
the requirements for the project. This was defined through user stories.

% The user stories are provided by the stakeholders. You will create the
% backlogs and the requirements, and document here. This chapter should
% contain details about each of the requirements and how the requirements are 
% or will be satisfied in the design and implementation of the system.

% Below: list, describe, and define the requirements in this chapter.  There
% could be any number of sub-sections to help provide the necessary level of
% detail.

\section{User Guide for HoloLens}

\section{User Guide for Mobile App}
There are four main screens available in the mobile app. These are the login, file listing, QR code reader, and AR view. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Login Screen
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You may log in using credentials for an account created on the website. Credentials will be saved after the app is closed if you check the box.
        \item Alternatively, you may "Continue Offline" if you don't have a login or don't need to sign in. 
        \item Offline users can view files that are already downloaded on the device and scan new QR codes for adding more models to their list.
    \end{itemize}
    \item File Listing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The files available to view are listed here.
        \item Some files are already downloaded on the device, and some files are available from the website.
        \item In offline mode, only downloaded files will appear.
        \item A user can select a file from the list. A file that is already downloaded will load in the AR View screen. A file that is not downloaded will be downloaded while a loading spinner appears to demonstrate that the download is in progress.
        \item There is a button available to access the QR Code Reader screen.
    \end{itemize}
    \item QR Code Reader
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The whole screen will be a live feed from the camera.
        \item The user can point their device at a mobile QR code and the app will automatically scan it, returning the user to the File Listing with the new file added.
        \item A user may use the back navigation button to return to the file listing if they choose not to scan a QR code.
    \end{itemize}
    \item AR View
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The AR view allows the user to view the 3D model in their own environment.
        \item The view will have a live feed from the phone's camera.
        \item Small blue points will appear as the phone maps out surfaces.
        \item The user may need to move the device around slowly and allow the phone a few seconds to map flat horizontal surfaces.
        \item When the trigrid appears over the surfaces, the user can tap the screen where they would like to place the model.
        \item After the model is placed, they can use the + and - buttons to change the size, as well as use the number input at the bottom to change how quickly the scale changes.
        \item The user should be able to move around the placed object to see it from different sides, while it remains anchored where it was placed.
        \item If the user covers the camera or turns too far away, the model may lose tracking and need to be replaced.
        \item The user may use the back navigation button to return to the file listing.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%This section should contain the basis for any end user documentation for the system. 
% End user documentation would cover the basic steps for setup and use of the system. 
% It is likely that the majority of this section would be present in its own document 
%to be delivered to the end user.  However, it is recommended the original is contained 
%and maintained in this document. 
%
%%\newpage   %% 
%%%  The user guide can be an external document which is included here if necessary ...
%%%  a single source is the way to go.
%
%\section{User Guide}
%
%The source for the user guide can go here.    You have some options for how to handle the user docs.  If you have some {\tt newpage} commands around the guide then you can just print out those pages.   If a different formatting is required, then have the source in a separate file {\tt userguide.tex} and include that file here.  That file can also be included into a driver (like the senior design template) which has the client specified formatting.  Again, this is a single source approach.

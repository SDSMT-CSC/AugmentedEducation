%This section should contain the basis for any end user documentation for the system. 
% End user documentation would cover the basic steps for setup and use of the system. 
% It is likely that the majority of this section would be present in its own document 
%to be delivered to the end user.  However, it is recommended the original is contained 
%and maintained in this document.

%%\newpage   %% 
%%%  The user guide can be an external document which is included here if necessary ...

%The source for the user guide can go here.    You have some options for how to handle the user docs.  If you have some {\tt newpage} commands around the guide then you can just print out those pages.   If a different formatting is required, then have the source in a separate file {\tt userguide.tex} and include that file here.  That file can also be included into a driver (like the senior design template) which has the client specified formatting.  Again, this is a single source approach.

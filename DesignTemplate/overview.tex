Provide a complete description of the client requested deliverables.   This section should be the section that your software contract refers to.
(e.g. prototype, documentation, code, users manual, ...)


\subsection{Software}
The main deliveralbe is a swoftware toolchain to save, retrieve, and view 3D models produced in popular modeling software.  The two main components are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A website to manage users' files
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Upload files
			\item Save files
			\item Run software to convert between 3D file types
			\item Serve files back to users
		\end{itemize}
	\item A file conversion program to convert a users uploaded file into a viewable file type
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Convert a given 3D model into a common file type to be stored on the website
			\item Convert the common file type to the type needed to be viewd on an Augmented Reality device
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hardware}

Test the flow of the website and file conversion software on popular Augmented Reality devices, witch may include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Microsoft Hololens
	\item Meta 2
	\item Mobile devices running IOS and/or Android
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}

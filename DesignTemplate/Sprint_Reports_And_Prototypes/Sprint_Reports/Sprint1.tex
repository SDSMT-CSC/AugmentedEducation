    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Successes}
    \label{sec:Sprint1_successes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designed website wireframes

                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item When a user uploads a file, store it alongside a converted STL format
                            \item Upon access request, convert the STL file to the specified client type
                            \item The converted client type file are stored with a limited lifetime
                            \item Serve the specified client type file to the user
                        \end{itemize}

            \item Able to upload simple files to the ASP.NET website's web root
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Deliverables}

        \item A prototype of the website
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Sprint Review}
    \label{sec:Sprint1_review}
        \hspace{7mm}
        The only item listed as a failure for this sprint was the ability to upload a simple file
        to the web root folder of the ASP.NET website.  The code had been written by the end of the 
        development sprint cycle, but had yet commited to the repository and therefore was not 
        reviewed and approved.  Testing the functionality of the feature was one of the primary 
        items in the next sprint development cycle.

    \subsection{Sprint Retrospective}
    \label{sec:Sprint1_retrospective}
        \hspace{7mm}
        The team is in agreement that the sprint went well. The only item not fully completed was the simple
        file upload, which can be attributed to only one member of the web team working on it while the others
        create early project documents and are being introduced to developing in ASP.NET. Items of interest 
        during the sprint include the arrival of the Oculus Rift VR headset. This has sparked discussions of
        supporting hardware. Future items to consider are focused around the supplemental hardware needs of the coming AR and VR devices such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the minimum hardware specifications for a computer to operate the device?
            \item Where to acquire a dedicated development computer with supported hardware?
            \item Where to store the dedicated computer? 
        \end{itemize}

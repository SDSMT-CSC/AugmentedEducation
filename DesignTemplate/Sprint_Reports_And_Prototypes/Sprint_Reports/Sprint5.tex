        A private development workspace is still yet to be reserved.\\

        QR codes still aren't done\\
        
        Collada file type research shows that.... Ask Aaron.

    \subsection{Sprint Retrospective}
    \label{sec:Sprint5_retrospective}
        \hspace{7mm}
        How did we feel about sprint 5? I'm really not sure.\\
        
        On the subject of finding a private development workspace, the decision remains unanimous that until one 
        is able to be reserved, working sessions involving the AR and VR equipment that is hardware dependent 
        will have to be scheduled with a team member who owns a laptop that meets the minimum hardware
        specifications.\\

        On the subject of fully implementing QR code generation, the decision remains that 
        the feature is not crucial to the function of the MVP and can be postponed until after the delivery
        of the MVP to be implemented.\\

        On the subject of Collada .dae file type research, .... Ask Aaron.

    \subsection{Sprint Review}
    \label{sec:Sprint3_review}
        \hspace{7mm}
        A private development workspace is still yet to be reserved.\\

        Conflicts with the SD Mines Buissiness Office have been resolved.  A miscommunication resulted in their
        understanding that the development team intended to be temporarily employed by SD Mines for the duration
        of the 2017-18 academic year to receive funds.  Following policy would then require that all IP be retained
        by SD Mines and not \textit{InTouch L.L.C.}  A problem now arises in that Dr. McGough serves as the PI for
        the SD Mines Mobile Computing Grant and has a percent stake ownership in \textit{InTouch L.L.C.}  Forwarding
        any money from the Mobile Computing Grant to \textit{InTouch L.L.C.} presents itself as a conflict of interest.\\
        
        In accordance with feedback from the first client presentation, it became apparent that some aspects of the 
        definition of the MVP were of a larger scope than necessary.  It also became known to the development team
        that one of the signers of the SD Mines Mobile Computing Grant intended to begin conducting research on the
        effectiveness of augmented reality in the classroom during the Spring 2018 semester.\\

        The Microsoft Hololens arrived and 3D files are able to be tested for AR compatibility.  Upon completing
        the gesture recognition tutorial, it was learned that the Hololens only supports one user account.  To
        change accounts is to factory reset the device and redo setup with a different user account.\\

        The question of file storage space was presented.  Microsoft ImagineX student development accounts do not
        offer space for document storage.  Research was done into the compatibility of Azure blob storage with 
        ImagineX student development accounts and similar options.\\
        
        Files that are uploaded to the ASP.NET web root folder are able to be successfully converted to an alternate
        file format.  Both the original file and the converted file are able to be downloaded from the ASP.NET web root
        folder.  The file conversion process must currently be invoked manually.\\

    \subsection{Sprint Retrospective}
    \label{sec:Sprint3_retrospective}
        \hspace{7mm}
        The team is mostly satisfied with the progress of the sprint.  The only failing items are automatic file
        conversion and reserving a private development workspace.\\

        On the subject of finding a private development workspace, the decision remains unanimous that until one 
        is able to be reserved, working sessions involving the AR and VR equipment that is hardware dependent 
        will have to be scheduled with a team member who owns a laptop that meets the minimum hardware
        specifications.\\

        On the subject of conflicts of interest, the unanimous decision between Dr. McGough and the representatives
        of \textit{InTouch L.L.C.} is that South Dakota Board of Regents policy will be followed to the letter.
        Including a reduced stake in company ownership and leaving decisions regarding purchase orders with the SD 
        Mines Mobile Computing Grant funds up to another SD Mines faculty member who is a signer for the grant.\\
        
        On the subject of the MVP, the unanimous decision of the development team was to refine the definition of
        the MVP and revise the tentative development timeline.  The planned focus group testing for the Spring 2018
        semester requires an MVP independent of individual user accounts on the system.  Work on developing user
        accounts and authentication will be postponed until after the delivery of the MVP.\\

        On the subject of Hololens accounts, the unanimous decision of the development team is that a Microsoft
        account will be created and used for the development of this project.  Once development is complete, the 
        device will be reset and returned to SD Mines for configuration.\\

        On the subject of file storage space, options considered were Microsoft OneDrive and Azure blob storage.
        Microsoft OneDrive only allows interfacing via the web from business subscriptions which remain too 
        expensive for the budget of this project and would add a large overhead cost to any future clients.
        Azure blob storage is offered (5 GB per month) for free for a year for a standard trial subscription.
        The unanimous decision of the development team is that when the point in the development process is reached
        where files need to be stored and maintained, the team's Azure subscription will be changed from the 
        ImagineX student developer subscription to the standard free subscription.\\
        
        On the subject of automatic file conversion, it is known that the process needs to be made synchronous
        in order to be automatically invoked when a file is uploaded to the ASP.NET web site.  The item will be
        presented in the backlog of the following sprint.

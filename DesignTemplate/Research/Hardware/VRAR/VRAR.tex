\subsection{Virtual and Augmented Reality}


    Virtual Reality (VR) is one of the fields explored during the development of the project.  VR headsets are designed to be fully immersive, so that the real world is blocked out in favor of the virtual.  This is different than AR where virtual objects are placed into the real world.  VR usually includes a headset tethered to a computer, tracking sensors placed in the room, and controllers.  On the other hand, AR devices usually rely on hand gestures to control the programs.

	A major component of the project was discovering what was available in the industry.  This included finding what hardware was available to support Virtual and Augmented Reality.  The goal was to find what was existing to develop the platform requested by the clients.  Exploration was performed on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices.  The following sections will summarize the research, including:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item What is AR and VR
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Differences between AR and VR
			\item Differences in hardware in each category
			\item Requirements to run the hardware
		\end{itemize}

		\item Web Technologies
		\item File Conversion
		\item Mobile Devices
	\end{itemize}
	
	It is important to remember that this section of the industry is rapidly developing.  What is presented in this document in May 2018 may be dated information shortly after.  Therefore, this research reflects the state of the technology from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018.

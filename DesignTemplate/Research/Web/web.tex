    \item View - HTML pages that you can embed C\# code in using Razor syntax.
    \item Controller - This contains function that the front end can call. All of the logic that needs to happen on the server side.

\subsection{Identity and Entity Framework}
Identity and Entity Framework is the standard framework for adding user accounts inside ASP.NET. This framework templates all work needed to add account registration, account login, and account authorization. It supports third-party login and two-factor authentication. 

This framework includes a highly customizable permission system based around "claims." Claims may used to store any authorization data that may be associated with a user profile for context. Authorization can then be based around verifying whether a user meets any or all conditions necessary to claim authorized access to data.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Android app
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Add support for embedded image files (png).  Needs to be able to load in, and display, multiple images on top of each other at once.  The app currently can handle one, but some models (especially those made in Paint3D) needs to have multiple displayed on top of each other to get the correct shading/color.

                \item Add filtering, ordering, and searching to the list of models.

                \item Add support for deleting models from the list.
            \end{itemize}
            \item ARKit app
        \end{enumerate}

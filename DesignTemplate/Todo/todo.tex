        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Android app
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Add support for embedded image files (png).  Needs to be able to load in, and display, multiple images on top of each other at once.  The app currently can handle one, but some models (especially those made in Paint3D) needs to have multiple displayed on top of each other to get the correct shading/color.

                \item Add filtering, ordering, and searching to the list of models.

                \item Add support for deleting models from the list.

                \item Search through the models directory and clean up the listing with models that do not exist.

                \item Add functionality to send a request to the website to get a displayable name from QR codes.
            \end{itemize}
            \item ARKit app
        \end{enumerate}

\chapter{Sprint Results and Prototypes}    
    \hspace{7mm}This chapter will cover the contents of the tracked sprint progress, as well as any tables, figures, or listings
    pertaining to prototypes througout the development lifecycle.\\

    Sprints are being organized in two-week long segments, starting with sprint 0 being a planning and preparation phase.
    Each sprint detailed in this chapter will consist of:
    \begin{itemize} \item The Backlog \end{itemize}
    
        The backlog of a sprint is to be a list of the items that the development team wishes to accomplish in the duration
        of that sprint. Examples of backlog items could be ``Update documentation for (x)'' or ``Research best practices for (y)''.
        Trivial items, such as fixing a spelling mistake will not be listed on the sprint backlog.\\

    \begin{itemize} \item Successes \end{itemize}
        
        Items from the sprint backlog that were successfully accomplished.  Items listed under the ``Successes'' section
        may contain notes containing specific instructions as to how an issue was resolved.\\

    \begin{itemize} \item Failures \end{itemize}
        
        Items from the sprint backlog that were not successfully accomplished.  Items listed under the ``Failures'' section
        will be accompanied with a description detailing the manner of the failure.  Items to be considered as failed for the
        sprint are backlog items that were not addressed, backlog items that were not fully accomplished, backlog items that
        were attempted to be completed but found to be unreasonable or infeasible (in which case, the requirement needs revision),
        or additional problems that are introduced during the sprint cycle.\\
    \begin{itemize} \item Deliverables \end{itemize}
        
        A description of items from the sprint backlog, more specifically from the ``Successes'' section by the end of the
        sprint cycle, that are considered of value in the hands of the project client.  These are items that validate the 
        continuation of the development process.  Items that are considered to be ``Deliverable'' include, but are not 
        limited to, documentation, wireframes/designs, prototypes, demonstrations, and of course the final product.\\

    \begin{itemize} \item Sprint Review \end{itemize}
       
        An overviewing analysis of the results of the sprint.  This section is where items from the original backlog
        are evaluated and officially labeled as having either passed or failed it's acceptance criteria.\\

        Items having passed their acceptance criteria are appropriately labeled as ``Successes'' for the sprint and are 
        removed from the backlog moving forward to the next sprint development cycle.\\

        Items having failed their acceptance criteria are appropriately labeled as ``Failures'' for the sprint and are
        left on the backlog moving forward to the next sprint development cycle.  The reason for an item being labelled
        as failing for the sprint will be documented and  the item will be re-evaluated to ensure it remains feasible.\\  

    \begin{itemize} \item Sprint Retrospective \end{itemize}
        
        This section will contain both positive and negative remarks from the development team regarding topics such as 
        the rate at which work was completed and the ratio of successes to failures.  Reasons for failing items will be
        discussed and, if needed, failed items will be re-delegated to one or more developers.\\

        This section also serves as an opportunity for the development team to evaluate the development process as a whole.
        Discussions can be held to suggest changes or improvements to how items are accomplished, or how the development
        process itself is managed.

\subsection{Successes and Failures}
    \subsubsection{Successes}
        \begin{itemize} \item Defined the MVP \end{itemize}
        \hspace{7mm}
        Upload a Maplesoft 3D object file to a website.  Have the website perform an automatic file conversion and 
        present the user with an AR Tag.  When the user views the AR Tag through an AR device, download and render 
        the 3D object file.

        \begin{itemize} \item Decided to develop with the Microsoft Hololens being the primary supported AR device. \end{itemize}
        \hspace{7mm} 
        A conscious decision was made in accordance with current technologies and the Mobile Computing Grant awarded 
        to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology that this service aims to satisfy to keep development 
        centered around the Hololens and other Microsoft supported or compatible tools and services.

        \begin{itemize} \item Decided to use Azure for cloud hosting services \end {itemize}
        \hspace{7mm}The decision was between using Azure cloud services or Amazon Web Services.
        Azure was voted as the better of the two options on the grounds that the primary device we intend to make work
        using this service is the Microsoft Hololens and compatibility conflicts should be avoided.

        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Created initial user stories 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item As a faculty member, I want to upload a maple file to a cloud server.

                \item As a faculty member, I want the maple file to be automatically converted to an AR tag on the 
                cloud server.

                \item As a faculty member, I want to be able to download the AR tag for my document from the cloud 
                server.

                \item As a user of this product, I want to be able to view the AR tag through a Microsoft Hololens 
                to render a 3D model.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize} \item Estimated tentative development timeline. \hyperref[itm:Sprint0-Timeline]{(See 6.1.2)} \end{itemize}

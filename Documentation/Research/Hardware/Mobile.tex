\subsection{Mobile Devices}

    Before working on the mobile app at the start of the spring semester, research was needed to be done on the types of phones and what software was supported on each.  As a note, this section uses the term phones which is meant to include tablets unless explicitly stated.  When researching the devices, the important factor was the general use of the phone (how many users are likely to have the device), price, and software support.  The main pieces of software support include ARKit for iOS and ARCore for Android.

    It was decided early on that more students have Android phones than iOS, so the decision was made to develop towards Android, and do an Apple app if time allowed.  However, due to difficulties in developing the Android app, the iOS app was not developed.  This is also stated in the TODO section.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item ARKit

            ARKit is Apple's AR software capabilities.  It runs on iPhones (6 and newer) and iPads (5th generation and pro).  

        \item ARCore

            ARCore is Google's AR software capabilities.  It supports a "wide variety of qualified Android phones running Android 7.0 (Nougat) and later" (ARCore website).  A full listing of supported devices can be found here: \url{https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices}.

            When a purchase of phones was needed to start development on the app, the only supported phones were the Google Pixel and Pixel2 and select models of the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Therefore, a Pixel2 and Galaxy S8 were purchased.

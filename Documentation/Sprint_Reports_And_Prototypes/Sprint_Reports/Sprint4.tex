    \subsection{Sprint Backlog}
    \label{sec:Sprint4_backlog}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reserve a development workspace
            \item File conversion on Azure as an automatic process
            \item Generate unique QR codes on a for each uploaded file
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Successes}
    \label{sec:Sprint4_successes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item File conversion on Azure is an automatic process
            \item Developed a plan for generating unique QR codes for each uploaded file
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Failures}
    \label{sec:Sprint4_failures}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unable to reserve a development workspace
            \item Unique QR code generation is not fully implemented 
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Deliverables}
    \label{sec:Sprint4_deliverables}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Demonstrate automatic file conversion when a file is uploaded
        \item Demonstrate unique QR code generation on a per-file basis
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Sprint Review}
    \label{sec:Sprint4_review}
        \hspace{7mm}
        A private development workspace is still yet to be reserved.\\

        File conversion on Azure has been corrected to be an automatic process.  Files that are uploaded to
        the ASP.NET web root folder are automatically converted to a different file type.\\

        Unique QR codes are able to be manually generated given a file path.  A plan exists for automating
        the process but is not yet implemented.

    \subsection{Sprint Retrospective}
    \label{sec:Sprint4_retrospective}
        \hspace{7mm}
        The team is mostly dissatisfied with the progress of the sprint.  The failing items are automatic
        QR code generation and reserving a private development workspace.  This is the first sprint in which
        most of the goals set forth by the starting backlog were not accomplished.  This is attributed to the
        time of the semester being near mid-term exams and little to no development being done.\\

        On the subject of finding a private development workspace, the decision remains unanimous that until one 
        is able to be reserved, working sessions involving the AR and VR equipment that is hardware dependent 
        will have to be scheduled with a team member who owns a laptop that meets the minimum hardware
        specifications.\\

        On the subject of fully implementing QR code generation, the unanimous decision of the development team 
        is that the feature is not crucial to the function of the MVP and can be postponed until after the delivery
        of the MVP to be implemented.

\section{Systems Goals}
The goal of this system is to establish a tool chain between CAD files and AR hardware. To this effect, the system must provide a web interface for users to upload CAD files to the cloud to be converted to file types render-able by AR hardware for on-demand downloading and rendering by AR devices.  

\section{System Overview and Description}

CAD software and AR hardware are assumed available for use of this platform. CAD file support for AR headsets is also a standard for current manufacturers. Thus, the three primary components of this platform are a web interface, file conversion software, and mobile app. The website is intended to drive both the upstream and downstream of data flow. The upstream is from the user to the cloud. The downstream is from the cloud to AR devices via QR code or direct download. Between these data streams rests file conversion software that is used to convert input files to output file types necessary for specific AR hardware. The website must also include a QR code generator plugin that is used for generating unique QR codes to associate with uploaded files. Custom AR file viewing is not conveniently supported with common features for mobile devices and a companion app for this platform must be developed. See Fig. \ref{fig:UMLSystemOverview} for a visual representation of the interacting components of this platform.

\subsection{Website}
%Describe briefly the role this major component plays in this system. 
This major component of the system brokers all interactions occurring across the platform. A user interface is used to control the data upstream between the user and the cloud. Functionality includes uploading, updating, and deleting files. The website provides QR code generation for uploaded files and create an association between an uploaded file and its QR code. Note, a target file type must be specified when generating a QR code. When a direct download link or QR code download link is used, the cloud supplies a file in its specified format to the calling device. 


\subsection{File Conversion}
The file conversion software converts files between common 3D file types. It is designed to be called from the back end of the website.

Table \ref{tab:suportedfiletypes} lists the minimum file types supported.  More may be supported, but those listed are the minimum needed to support the majority of common file types.  
Models created in most computer aided design software can export to at least one of these common input file types.

\begin{table}[!h]

    \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
        \hline
        Input file type & Output file type \\
        \hline
        FBX & FBX \\
        DAE & DAE \\
        BLEND & OBJ \\ 
        OBJ & STL \\
        STL & PLY \\
        PLY & \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Supported File Types}
    \label{tab:suportedfiletypes}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mobile Device}
Mobile devices such as phones and tablets are able to download and view 3D files from the website. In the Android app, users can log in and see a listing of their private files, as well as scan QR codes to access additional files. Selecting one of these files allows them to view it in AR on the device. The Android app uses OBJ files retrieved from the website.

\subsection{HoloLens}
The HoloLens is a standalone AR device with advanced features and built-in software. The QR code reader software on the HoloLens can be used to scan a QR code and get a link to the file from the website. After downloading this file, the HoloLens user can view and interact with the model in an AR environment with the default viewer from Microsoft. The HoloLens uses FBX files retrieved from the website.

 \section{Architecture and System Design}
 
   \subsection{Design Selection}
 Many design tools and coding stacks were considered for the foundation of this project. It was further noted that the selection of a development environment, cloud services, and platform hosting would play the largest roles in design considerations for the rest of the project. 
 
 Azure cloud hosting tools were the first component selected with the following justification: 

 \begin{itemize}
    \item Allows for simple database and web hosting.
    \item Paid features offered free to students.
    \item Supported by other Microsoft services and platforms. 
    \item Manufacturer support for target headset (Microsoft HoloLens)
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{}
 ASP.NET MVC was selected for the web development stack with the following justification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Majority of the developers had experience with C\# and Visual Studio.
    \item Decision to use Azure made ASP.NET MVC a natural choice as they are both part of the Microsoft stack.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
Other options considered were Amazon Web Service for cloud hosting and Linux development environment using Python and Django for the back-end logic. These were not chosen due to lack of prior experience on the development team. 

 \subsection{Data Flow}
The web interface for users creates a data upstream that exists between a web browser and a cloud server. Users may upload and delete remotely hosted files.

Data downstream exists between the cloud server and AR hardware. Data downstream is initiated by users calling the file download through QR codes or direct download links. 

When a file is uploaded, a QR code generator plugin generates and delivers a unique QR code to the web interface to be downloaded by the user and stored on the cloud server in association with the related file. 

When a file is accessed by an AR device, conversion software converts the file to the appropriate AR compatible file type before delivery. This converted file is stored on the cloud server for a limited time to streamline repeated and multi-user access.
  
\subsection{UML}

\subsection{UX}

Due to the size and complexity of this platform, user experience testing could not be conducted until an MVP was delivered in February 2018. To conduct user experience testing, the user-facing platform components were shown to individual members of the client panel. During these sessions, the chosen member of the client panel inspected and critiqued the following elements of the user experience:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Appearance
	\item Ease of use
	\item Help and guidance features
    \item Ease of locating control features 
    \item Ease of locating elements of interest
    \item Speed of content delivery 
    \item Perceived value and practicality of platform
\end{itemize}
